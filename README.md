# Rollercoaster-Ricket-Machine-v2
100 DoC Python Day 3 Project: Rollercoaster Ticket Machine 2.0 (Improved Version)
### This Python program does the following:
1. Takes user height in cm as input
2. If the height is greater than 120cm: 
    * Takes user input for age in years
    * Uses if/elif statements to define the ticket price on the basis of user's age group
    * Asks the user if they want a photo taken, and adds to the price of bill based on user's input
3. If the height is less than 120cm, lets the user know and exits the program without any further code execution
